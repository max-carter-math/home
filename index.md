I am a research student at the University of Newcastle in Australia currently completing my Master's in mathematics. My research interests lie firmly in the areas of group theory and operator algebras. More specifically, I am mostly interested in the study of locally compact groups, their representation theory and related problems concerning operator algebras. I am also interested in operator algebras as a topic in themselves.
